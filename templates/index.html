Vascular calcifications are noted bilaterally</td><td>Mineral deposits of calcium along blood vessels in both breasts. This is a normal finding and not a sign of breast cancer.</td></tr><tr><td>

Comparison: None</td><td>The comparison section describes any mammograms you had in the past that the radiologist looked at to see if there were any small changes.</td></tr><tr><td>

Findings:
There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density</td><td>Breasts are made of fat and gland tissue. The amount of fat and gland tissue in the breast determines how the breast will look on a mammogram. The more gland tissue in a breast, the more white the breast appears on a mammogram. The amount of fat and gland tissue in the breast is graded from 1 to 4, all of which are normal. 1 means mostly fat tissue. 4 means mostly gland tissue. Your breast scores 2 which means that there is slightly more fat than gland tissue. This is normal.</td></tr><tr><td>
